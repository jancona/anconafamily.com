<p>We had a busy day today. When we got up between 7:30 and 8:00 we
cooked breakfast. We had bacon, eggs and home fries. We left the
campground about 10:30. From there we went to Bryce Canyon where we went
to the most beautiful and breathtaking overlook yet, Inspiration point.

</a> 
After we left, it looked like it was going to rain. Then we went to St.
Dominic’s Mission Church for 12:15 Mass. It was a cute little church and
a nice Mass. Then we headed to Cedar Breaks National Monument. On the
way it poured. It was a beautiful place, but at 10,000 feet it was
cold.</p>

</a> 

<p>We did not stay for long since we didn’t have sweatshirts with us.
Then we went to different viewpoints including an 11,500 foot mountain
peak! Then we headed home. On the way I finished <I>To Kill a
Mockingbird</I>. We got back at around 5:00 and Mark and I hung around
the rec room while Mom and Dad cooked dinner. For dinner we had canned
ham, rice and beets. Afterwards Mark fed the horses. Mom and Dad wrote
postcards and I started <I>The Illiad </I>(it is a really confusing
book).</p> 

<h2>Day 16 - Monday, July 12</h2>

</a> 
<p>Off to Zion this morning. The day started off mostly cloudy again,
but the sun came out as we got to the park- less than an hour away. We
passed through huge multicolored rock mounds as we came into the park.
We stopped at the canyon overlook trail, right before the tunnel into
the valley. We hiked up to the overlook for a spectacular view of the
valley and canyon. We went through the 1.1 mile long tunnel into Zion
Canyon. We drove the road as far as we could into the canyon, hoping to
beat the crowds. We didn’t succeed in doing that, there was lots of
traffic and people, the most we’ve seen anywhere so far. Still, we found
a parking place and had a nice walk along the river to the point where
the canyon narrow and the trail ends. Beautiful sheer walls and hanging
gardens were the scenery along the trail.</p>

</a> 
<p>We had a picnic lunch at the Grotto picnic area then drove to the
visitor center for a ranger talk on the park’s geology and a movie about
the park. We drove out of the park into the town of Springdale. By this
time the sun was really hot and we finally felt like we were in the
desert. We bought an ice cream and a sticker for the camper, then
decided to head home so the boys could swim in the pool. Unfortunately,
when we got back the pool was drained! Evidently it had been flooded
with mud in the thunderstorm the other day and they hadn’t been able to
refill it yet. We had another thunderstorm while cooking dinner then
read and played spades until bedtime.</p> 

<h2>Day 17 - Tuesday, July 13</h2>

</a> 
<p>It was still overcast and dreary with a few showers so we didn’t
hustle out to the Grand Canyon. The boys slept in a little. We were on
the road by 10:30 AM. We stopped in Kanab on the Utah/Arizona border to
grocery shop for our three days in the canyon. Drove through barren
desert land then climbed 3-4,000 feet to get on the Kiabab Plateau. Once
again, pretty trees, aspens and firs. Turned the clock back, Arizona
keeps standard time. Beautiful campsite on the outer edge of the North
Rim. It rained on the way in, stopped when we set up and started again,
cool and damp weather. We can walk to the edge, about 4 campsites away.
We made ramen and hot dogs for lunch and a nice steak over the campfire
for dinner. We played spades again, the boys are getting better. </p> 

<h2>Day 18 - Wednesday, July 14</h2> 
<h3>Mark</h3> 

<a href="images/gc_mark_75.jpg">

</a> 
<p>It was a cruddy day. In the morning it rained a lot. About 11:06 it
let up. I got out of the camper and found my friends! Then we went to
the lodge and got dinner reservations. We came back to eat ramen. Then I
went to play cards with my friends. Later I was going through Tom’s
belongings and Dad got mad. We went to a sight seeing place, then took
showers. The dinner was great! We came back, played cards and went to
bed.</p> 

<h2>Day 19 - Thursday, July 15</h2> 
<h3>Tommy</h3> 

<a href="images/gc_mules_75.jpg">
<img src="images/gc_mules_sm.jpg" align="right" width=219 height=147 alt="Two Asses" hspace=5 vspace=5>
</a> 
<p>We had a really busy day starting at 2:00 AM with a giant
thunderstorm that woke everyone up. In the morning we got up early and
ate breakfast while Mom did laundry. Then dad dropped Mark and I off for
the mule ride. I had a slow one named Ernie and Mark had a disgusting
one named Festus. It was a fun hour riding them. When we got back we met
Mom at the Lodge where they had breakfast. Then we went to a pretty
viewpoint called Cape Royal. It is the only place where you can see the
Colorado River on the North Rim. When we got back we had lunch and
almost left because of possible T-storms. It cleared up. Dad and I went
for a 4 mile hike in the Canyon. When we got back we had hot tacos. Then
Dad and I took showers.</p> 

<h2>Day 20 - Friday, July 16</h2>

</a> 
<p>Finally a bright and sunny day. Time to leave the canyon. We drove 40
miles to Jacob Lake and stopped for gas. The attendant there sold me on
an oil change (which we needed). Mom drove down off the Kaibab Plateau.
When we stopped at a scenic overlook to see the Vermillion Cliffs, we
noticed the brakes were smoking! I guess Mom had been riding them too
much. After letting them cool a bit, I drove the rest of the way down
then across the Colorado at Marble Canyon. We saw some brightly colored
formations where we turned off US 89 onto US 160. We stopped in Tuba
City and had pizza for lunch. We were the only Anglo’s in the
place-everyone else was Indian. </p> 

<p>Mom drove across the desert to Four Corners where we stopped for
pictures. We looked at some Navaho crafts and had some fry bread. Then
we drove on through Cortex, Colorado to Mesa Verde. </p> 

<p>We found a nice campsite in the park after driving up lots of
switchbacks onto the mesa. It was warm while we set up, but cooled off
quickly when the sun went down. We had chili for dinner and went to bed
fairly early. </p> 

<h2>Day 21 - Saturday, July 17</h2>

</a> 
<p>What a nice day! Headed up the mesa, Jim driving of course! Stopped
and walked Spruce House, one of the Anaszai cliff dwellings. They lived
on the mesa, the pit house ruins were from 500-600 AD, then pueblo
foundations and finally the cliff dwellings from 1200 - 1300 AD. We took
a formal ranger led tour of Cliff House, it was wonderful. Drove about
on the mesa, had a picnic lunch, explored various sites and back to the
campground. Too late for Mass tonight, not much food. We bought
hamburger and buns and cooked them slowly over the coals. (Not many
coals either.) I made hashbrowns, ketchup for veggies. We all took

</a> 
showers, 10¢ to get in and $1.00 for a shower. We assisted aman from New
Mexico who had locked his keys in his car, it’s nice to do. Our day
ended with a Native American story teller, the park was having an arts
and crafts festival and the evening program. We caught the last portion,
it was great. </p> 

<p> A beautiful campsite, not many people, many deer. I saw a mother and
baby when I got up this morning. I’d like to stay longer. Nice first
touch of Colorado. </p>
