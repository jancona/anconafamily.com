Dear Friends,
</p><p>
Merry Christmas to you and your loved ones.  I conducted a workshop on simplifying Christmas and putting more joy and less stress into the holiday. One part of the workshop had you inventory all you do for the holiday and decide how important each was to you. Christmas cards remain at the top of my list, even in these days of increasing postal rates and anthrax. I so enjoy hearing from you and finding out what’s new since last year. This may be the only communication I have with you all year and I’d hate to lose this connection, however tenuous.  For those the boys don’t know or remember, I explain who you are and how we know each other. It always brings back good memories.

I’ll fill you in on the Ancona year. Jim & I celebrated our 20th anniversary in June. We finally managed to get away in September, driving to Quebec City via Moosehead Lake. We’d never been up there in the fall. It was a wonderful five days; the boys were great for my mother. We all went white water rafting on the Kennebec while we were in Maine this summer! What a blast. I earned points in un-whimphood from the boys.  A high point of the year was the wedding of my best/oldest friend Claire. She and Rahim Gul were married September 3rd. It was a picture perfect wedding and the first we attended as a family.  Finally I have become the shortest in the family. Mark grew about 6 inches this past year and whipped past me, I don’t think I’ve started shrinking yet.  Some of these events are pictured on our home page. Check it out at:

 I am still Parish Nursing. I went to Colorado in October for a wonderful 5-day parish nurse preparation program. When Parish Nursing becomes a subspecialty, I’ll be eligible to take the exam. I went out with Eileen Birch, a fellow Parish Nurse; we stayed the weekend in Denver with her cousin before driving up to Saint Malo Retreat Center, near Rocky Mountain National Park. I’m still involved in Scouting, choir and am now secretary for the Diocesan Commission for Women.  I spend a lot of time driving kids around. With Tom licensed it is a big help.
