<p>I increased my hours to 16 this fall. I love what I do and
feel like I am making a difference in the parish. I am on the board of a
Christian retreat ministry in Vermont and get up to Londonderry 4-5 times year.
It’s a beautiful place and near Weston Vermont, so I’m able to worship at
Weston Priory. I made a Cursillo this summer, which was a very intense Catholic
retreat experience. It was awesome! I am co-editor of the Parish Nurse
newsletter, I write the scout newsletter and calendar and help out at school as
needed. I took the bus to Washington, DC for the March for Life last January.
I’m too old to ride a bus two nights! It was a wonderful experience. I hope to
take Tommy this year. I have been able to put off my hip for another year. It
hasn’t slowed me down too much.</p>

<p>Jim and I had a wonderful anniversary this year. Not sure
what we’ll do for the 20<sup>th</sup> next year, not much can top the 19<sup>th</sup>.
We went to Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Salzburg and Oberammergau on a 12 day
tour. It was tremendous. Though we have decided we’re not “tour” people, next
time we’ll do it on our own. Highlights were a moonlight cruise on the Danube
in Budapest, wandering a street fair in Vienna, attending the passion play at
Oberammergau. My mother, Aunt Marie and Aunt Pat came along, it was so much
fun. The bus offered water, soda or beer for $1.00. The beer was wonderful
Czech beer so we had to drink! Jim and I look forward to many more times
together as the boys get older and head along their own ways. </p>

<p>Our families are well. Jim’s sister Katia is still living in
Greenville, ME. We went up in the winter for the first time. Skied in our cove
on Moosehead Lake! The boys skied Squaw Mountain with Katia. We hope to do that
again this winter. Peter and family are well, as are Jim’s parents. We try to
get down as often as we can, which is not often enough. </p>
