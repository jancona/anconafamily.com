<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Christmas! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve been putting off this letter because it’s so hard to
boil down a year to one page or one letter. It’s been interesting. I just got a
card today that talks about the best of times and the worst of times…  I can
relate! Where to begin? First, the house looks great. We moved back in two days
before Christmas last year. It all seems like a bad dream with a wonderful
ending. We just put a Vermont Castings propane stove in the living room. It
completes the room and is wonderfully warm and inviting. My hip is excellent. I
should have done it years ago!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tom finished off his St. John’s career in fine style.
Graduation was a wonderful day for us all. He had many fine schools to choose
from (Dartmouth not among them) and some very generous financial aid packages.
After a great deal of thought (and prayer), Tom decided to attend the University
 of Chicago. In April he and Jim went out to a program for admitted students
and he decided that it was the school for him. Tom was home for Thanksgiving and
seemed very happy. It was obviously the right choice. He loves the school, his
classes, his friends and the city. It’s only a two hour plane ride from Providence
and not too expensive on Southwest. Chicago has a core curriculum that occupies
most of the first two years, so he won’t choose a major for a while. At present
he is considering international studies or political science. He is involved in
Model UN and is looking forward to the St. John’s MUN club coming out for the
annual conference in January. He volunteers at Doc Films, the student film
society, which allows him to also attend movies for free in his spare time. He
worked at Hoyt’s, now Regal Cinemas all summer and is coming back for Xmas
vacation. Great job, took me to four or five movies. My favorite was Finding
Nemo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I left my job as Parish Nurse in May. With Tom attending
college I needed to get back in the ‘real’ work force. I am working for UMass
Memorial Hospice. I am a per-diem nurse and have worked consistently 3 to 4
days a week, plus on-call and some weekends. It’s been busy. I just recently
got my own caseload as one of our nurses left and I offered to fill in until
someone new is ready. The people I work with are great and I really like what I
do. It is rewarding to help individuals and families during very difficult
times. It’s as close to parish nursing as I can get right now. I just got back
from Vermont where I hosted Koinonia’s annual parish nurse retreat. It was a
beautiful time away with the new snow. I’d like to stay per-diem but don’t know
what the future holds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jim just officially lost his job. The startup he worked for
ran out of money. They were pursuing new financing up until very recently, but
ultimately the deal never came together. He has been househusband for a bit and
helping with things around here. It’s been a Godsend. He is now sending out
emails and resumes to contacts and hopes to come up with something before too
long. I can probably go on staff</p>
