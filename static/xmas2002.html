<p >Dear Friends,</p>

<p >Merry Christmas! Hoping 2002 was a good year
for you and your loved ones. Lots to fill you in on, some of you I have kept
somewhat up to date with emails. We are in the midst of construction. The
downstairs had been gutted completely mid September and is gradually being put
back together. We have walls, windows, the pine floors under layers of carpets
and hardwood now look lovely. It was a pleasant surprise. We have hardwood in
the kitchen, the cabinets are in the process of being installed and appliances
are coming tomorrow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have a storage
unit in the back yard with all the downstairs furniture, kitchenware etc.. My
Christmas music is out there somewhere. I hope to access them soon. We have
moved the couch, TV, Computer etc. upstairs. Our room is sort of like a dusty
Grand Central Station. The clincher is cooking and eating out in our pop up
camper, which is in the side yard. It was kind of fun and an adventure in
September and October. We have three propane burners, the microwave, toaster
oven and crockpot. Our refrigerator is on the front
porch. The half and half froze over the weekend. It has been unseasonably cold
this November. There is a little heater, not designed for winter use. We have a small space heater when we are in
there. I did put the Christmas candles
in the house windows this weekend to make it appear more Christmaslike.
Tom hung lights around the outside of the camper. I think the end is in sight, which is a
relief. Our contractor and friend, Arthur Gibree has
done a wonderful job.</p>

<p >I guess the other big news is that I have a
new metal hip! I was told 4 years ago it was coming and when I was ready. It
had reached the point where I couldn’t walk anywhere for any distance or length
of time, even grocery shopping was difficult. Jim had done a great deal of
research on alternatives and options and felt we should look into hip
resurfacing, a less aggressive treatment option. We sent x-rays to Baltimore
(the closest site) and saw the doctor in April who felt I was a candidate.
Surgery was scheduled for June and then postponed. I ended up with a weeks
notice and had surgery July 26<sup>th</sup> at Sinai in Baltimore.
