<p>We got up early to go to Mass in Durango. We got going later than we
thought, so went to the 10:00 Mass instead of the 9:00. While we were at
church Dad did laundry. After we traveled in the car to the Great Sand
Dunes National Monument. It was fun but it lasted for 5 minutes until it
started raining. It was more like an hour, and it poured and
thundered and lightninged. I felt bad for the people on top of the 700
foot tall dune. It didn’t look like it was going to stop anytime soon,
so it wasn’t worth it to set up camp so we headed along. Then we
went to Colorado Springs. We stayed at the Garden of the Gods
Campground. </p> 

<h2>Day 23 - Monday, July 19</h2> 
<h3>Tommy</h3> 

<p>We started off our day at Garden of the Gods Campground, in Colorado
Springs. We got up at around 8:00, ate breakfast, took showers and
packed up. We got out at about 10:00. From the campground, we headed to
Pike’s Peak. We took the car up to the top of the 14,110 foot mountain.
At the top it was foggy and cold. We had a picnic lunch at the visitors
center partway down the mountain. From there we headed towards Rocky
Mountain National Park. We hit traffic and thunder storms on our way
around Denver. We stopped in Boulder to get groceries and headed to
Estes Park where we would camp. We got there about 7:00 and went to
Mary’s Lake Campground. We got a site away from everyone and had dinner
at 9:30 PM. Before that we played basketball with some other kids. After
supper we did dishes and went to bed. </p>
