and get benefits if it becomes necessary. He
is still chairman of the finance committee in town, which can be a lot of work.
We still sing in the church choir and get out on dates more often which is fun.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We so enjoyed being wrestling parents last winter, Mark was
on varsity at 126 pounds and did amazingly well. He just missed the states and
would have made it if he hadn’t gotten hurt. Mark did play town soccer in the
spring and his team made it to the state finals. His team became one of the
co-champions as we got about 8 inches of rain that night and day and no soccer was
played. Mark left St. John’s after the first semester this fall and is back at
Tahanto, the regional public high school. He is a junior this year. We hope he
will be happier and successful there. He has had a rough fall, struggling to
find himself. It has been hard for us also. He did make his confirmation this
fall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our families are busy. My brother Jack and Jo Louise’s
oldest, Daniel, was bar mitzvah’ed in April. There was a great party at the Immigration
 Museum in Boston. Jo Louise has been through a lot. She has been on dialysis
since the summer and is a candidate for a kidney transplant at some point.
Despite that they took all three kids to Disney in August. Bailey, Mark and
Tobey’s oldest, also graduated and is attending Connecticut College in New
  London. Still two more at home to keep them busy. Tobey was in a car accident
this fall and just had surgery on her wrist this past week. Katherine and
Michael and kids are doing really well. My Dad seemed to finally be doing
better, but then he got a kidney stone and is still recuperating from that. I
hope we can have a 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary party on their 51<sup>st</sup>
in June.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jim’s parents are well. We really enjoyed having them here
for Thanksgiving this year. We are spending Christmas with them in New Jersey
this year. We’ll sing at midnight mass and head down after breakfast Christmas
Day. His father had a hernia surgery this past week. Their dog Willie died this
year. Peter and Kathleen’s oldest daughter Sara began high school this year and
Emily turned 13. Katia, who has way too much stuff to be a free spirit, packed
her many bags and filing cabinets and massage table and headed to California in
November, visiting friends en-route. She is out in the Bay Area looking for
work and a place to live, while staying with friends in the area. We’ll miss
her in Maine. We bought a new boat for Maine this year, sold the Chris Craft
and got something speedy we can water ski with. The kids had a ball this
summer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jim put the “Year in Pictures” on our web page, so if you go
to <a href="http://www.anconafamily.com/">www.anconafamily.com</a> and follow
the link, you can see a lot of what I described…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, thanks for your continued presence in our lives and
stay tuned! Wishing you God’s Blessings at Christmas and in the New Year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With love,</p>
