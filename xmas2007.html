<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=RIGHT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dear Friends, 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I sit here at my
kitchen table. I can watch the birds at the feeders and the little
snow on the ground. How come Christmas comes so fast and unexpectedly
every year? Here is a fairly concise update on our lives and those we
love. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I hit the big 50 in
March and had asked Jim to take me to spring training for my
birthday. We did go to Florida, staying a few nights with Jim&rsquo;s
Aunt Judy and Uncle John in St. Pete. Jim&rsquo;s mother and Uncle Ed
were there, so it was a fun time. We then headed down to Fort Myers
area, staying on Sanibel Island. Saw Dice-K pitch his first American
game. Enjoyed the warmth and the baseball, had tickets for four
games. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jim has dealt with
health challenges this year, including an ER visit during our Florida
trip and a second a couple days before Tom&rsquo;s graduation. It was
eventually diagnosed as pan &ldquo;involving all&rdquo; sinusitis.
After many antibiotics, steroids and finally surgery in September, we
continue to try to figure it out! In the midst of this he ended up
with hepatitis from the medicines, which did resolve.  I did learn
how to use the power mower this summer and was proud of my grass
mowing skills. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We traveled to San
Francisco in May, Jim was at a conference and I had a ball. I would
head out every day to tour the city and geocache too. I would come
back and download pictures to show him my day. We did see Katia, who
lives in Berkeley, quite a bit.  I took her to Fisherman&rsquo;s
Wharf and she rode the cable cars for the first time. We went to Muir
Woods and Point Reyes National Seashore with her on our last day.
What a beautiful city and lovely area!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We then traveled to
Chicago in June for Tom&rsquo;s graduation. The attendees included my
mom, Jim&rsquo;s parents and Jo Louise, Jack&rsquo;s wife. Graduation
was a beautiful day. We did take the guests on a boat tour of the
river and lake and spent time over the weekend doing tourist things. 
Tom has stayed in Chicago. He started work the day we left at the
Univ. of Chicago Graduate School of Business. He is a program manager
in the Polsky School of Entrepreneurship. Tom has enjoyed this,
especially having no business background. He has a studio apartment
in Hyde Park. I spent a weekend with him in September, doing a
mother&rsquo;s touch on things, as well as a White Sox baseball game
and Greektown and caching. Tom was home for a long weekend at the
beach in July and a week at Moosehead with us in August. He was also
home for his and Jim&rsquo;s bdays in October and Thanksgiving. We
have a regular Southwest Airlines shuttle..so is it Manchester,
Providence or Hartford this time???  He is happy, well, gainfully
employed and has health insurance and dental. What more could parents
want? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mark is doing well. It
is always an adventure with him. He is living in Worcester with his
girlfriend, now fianc&eacute;, Michelle and Zach (2) and Isaiah (1).
He is working full time at a factory in Holden, Michelle works nights
at Dunkin Donuts. They plan to marry in April and are good parents to
the boys. Jim and I took the two of them to the zoo this fall, it was
fun but exhausting! Isaiah has stayed over a few times and is
walking. We had them outside playing in the leaves when Tom was home
in October, so much fun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jim&rsquo;s company,
Constant Contact went public this fall. He still commutes into
Waltham and enjoys his work. I am still with UMass Memorial Hospice,
per diem working 3 days a week. Now that tuitions are finished I can
take a little more time off now and then. I still love to geocache,
passed 700 in November. I am chairperson of the Commission for Women
of the Diocese of Worcester. We had a women&rsquo;s conference in
November, had over 650 women come, it was phenomenal. I gave Jim
season&rsquo;s tickets to Holy Cross basketball for his birthday, so
we have enjoyed going to games. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bailey, Mark and
Tobey&rsquo;s oldest graduated from Conn College in May. He is
teaching math at Brentwood HS, Nashville, TN. His girlfriend,
Elizabeth is in graduate school at Vanderbilt.  Leland is in his
second year at Bowdoin. We saw a game in November at Babson and plan
to get up north a few times after the holiday to watch hockey. Ross,
their youngest is a freshman in high school.  Jack and Jo Louise&rsquo;s
oldest Daniel is a senior in high school, Sam and Aviva are in
elementary school.  Jack is in middle school, he quit banking and is
almost finished his masters in education. He is &lsquo;student&rsquo;
interning this year and loves it.  Katherine and Michael have two
high school students, Maggie was just in South Pacific, she made a
very cute nurse!  Sara, Peter and Kathleen&rsquo;s oldest graduated
from high school in June. We celebrated that with her as well as Mary
Ann&rsquo;s 75<SUP>th</SUP> birthday. Sara is attending the College
of NJ, Ewing NJ just a short distance from their home. Emily is a
junior. We are traveling to PA this weekend to finally see her dance
in the Nutcracker. Can&rsquo;t wait! Our parents are still glad to
see us! Betty made it to the beach this summer, she still walks and
bikes a little. Mary Ann plays bridge and does her aerobics. Jim and
his brother went down this fall to help with yard work. I know his
parents were happy and grateful to see their boys. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And of course the Red
Sox won the World Series, life is good. We have pictures of
graduation, family and travels at <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.anconafamily.com/gallery">www.anconafamily.com/gallery</A></U></FONT>

expected. Hoping this finds you well. Wishing you health and
happiness in the New Year.</P>
