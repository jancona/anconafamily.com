Jim keeps busy on his computer. It is amazing the things he reads and comes up with. His job is still there! With the downturn of the economy, many start-ups have folded, but Xevo is doing all right. He has become the chairman of the Boylston finance committee this year.  We were in New Jersey for his Grandmother Reynolds’s 90th birthday in August.

Tom is a junior; he just got his high school ring. Tom got his driver’s license in May and is a competent, cautious driver. He is in the National Honor Society. He was in the newspaper a couple weeks ago with a young writer’s convention he attended at St. John’s. My two sister-in-laws saw his picture in the Boston Globe West! Tom attended the Boy Scout National Jamboree at Fort AP Hill in Virginia and had a wonderful time. Enroute they stopped at West Point, Amish Country and Gettysburg. Tom loved Gettysburg, having just finished reading Killer Angels. He is Senior Patrol Leader for his troop and is involved in Order of the Arrow, a Scout honor society. Model United Nations, a club at St. John’s has been wonderful. The club put on a conference at St. John’s this fall. Tom went to Chicago with them last winter. On their trip to New York the delegates were able to visit the UN and vote from the floor! He is starting to get college information in the mail. Tom continues to think towards history or political science.  He received the sacrament of confirmation this fall, the week after his 17th birthday. He picked Thomas More as his confirmation name. It was a great day.

Mark started his freshman year at St. John’s. He had a wonderful 8th grade graduation in June. We were contacted by Mark’s biological father last winter and have gotten together a few times. Mark (Sr.) came to graduation with us. He was impressed with what a fine young man Mark is becoming. Mark was on the freshman soccer team. He was not a starter at the beginning of the year, but after scoring a winning goal, that soon changed. Scored 7 goals this season and enjoyed himself. He is starting wrestling this semester. It seems like something he will enjoy. Mark likes the dances at St. John’s and the comradery, finds the academics a bit daunting, settling in though. St. John’s won the state soccer championship this fall and we spent a glorious December day, in shirtsleeves watching the football team win the Super Bowl.

Our families are fine and busy. All the Fidler siblings and children will get together New Years Day. There are 18 when we all get together.  My father continues to stay close to home. Mom is getting out more, which is good. We spent Thanksgiving in New Jersey with Jim’s family. It’s a smaller gathering, with only the 4 grandchildren. Jim’s parents are well. His sister Katia stayed in Maine for the holiday. She came down for Tommy’s confirmation and we will see her over Christmas.

The events of September 11th, have affected us all. We look at the world differently. I hope the tragedy did not have personal significance to you or your loved ones. Carolyn George, a Parish Nurse from Worcester lost her 27-year-old daughter on one of the flights out of Boston. I pray God will be with you and especially with those who have suffered losses. We ask God’s blessings on us all as family, friends, a nation and a world. Wishing you a peace filled, joyous Christmas and all the best in 2002.
