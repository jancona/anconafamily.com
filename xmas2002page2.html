<p>
As it turned out they were unable to
resurface, as the acetabular prosthesis couldn’t screw
in, so I have a new metal on metal total hip that will hopefully last me my
lifetime. The boys stayed with friends and family, Tom flew down and he and Jim
toured DC colleges on a one hundred degree day. I had surgery on Thursday, was
discharged on Tuesday and Jim drove me home on Wednesday. He has been my saving
grace through this whole process. I couldn’t have done it without him.
Recuperation was fine. I have more range of motion and no pain. We saw the
doctor the day before Thanksgiving. He gave me clearance to do anything with no
restrictions. I still can’t put on my shoe and sock, but can reach my foot, so
it is coming. I joined the YWCA and take a water aerobics class which is good
for stretching and moving. I am back to Parish Nursing and busy with all my
other activities.</p>

<p >Jim still has a job! He was told in the
spring the company was closing as many start-ups in Massachusetts have
been. He went in the next day to get his
walking papers and was then told they were keeping 14, (of 70) of which Jim was
one. The company is trying to find its
niche in high tech. Jim is head of the Finance Committee in town. He and I
enjoy more time to ourselves while the boys are busy working or out and about.</p>

<p >Tom is a senior and very busy. We had fun
this spring looking at colleges.  He has
applied early decision at Dartmouth. He
should hear by December 15<sup>th</sup>. He is a very smart young man, but
nothing is a shoo-in. If he doesn’t get in it will be a busy two weeks getting
his other applications in order for Jan. 1<sup>st</sup>. He still loves history and political science
and is greatly involved in Model UN at school. He is taking 4 AP courses this year and an after school extra-curricular
course on Greek and Roman History. He has a job at Hoyt’s movie theatre,
usually working Friday and Sat. evenings. The fringe benefit is free movies,
when he has time, which isn’t often. He
remains a sports buff and bought a four pack to Fenway
Park this year (very cheap bleacher seats). Tom has cut back on Scouts due to
time constraints. He turned 18 this fall and is now an adult member of the
troop. He also voted for the first time in the November election. </p>

<p >Mark is 16 and a sophomore. He has a part time job working for some
elderly neighbors. He helps takes care of their chickens, garden, greenhouse
and whatever else needs doing. He has learned many new skills and seems to
enjoy it. I enjoy the flexibility and convenience. He did all right freshman
year, if he ever puts effort into his schoolwork, he could be quite a student.
He did not make the soccer team this fall. It was a hard lesson to learn. He
thoroughly enjoyed wrestling last winter, which starts today. Hopefully he’ll
be getting his learner’s permit this winter. He remains our social animal, the
girls call constantly. We all went to the MLS soccer final at Gillette Stadium
in October. The boys were great when I was convalescing. They can cook, clean,
grocery shop and do laundry. We’ve done something right!</p>

<p >My mother, Betty had a knee replacement in
early November. She had the first one
done three years ago and did well. I spent a few days post op doing “private
duty”. After my inpatient experience I
realize nursing care isn’t the same as it was 25 years ago when I entered the
field. I also spent a few days with her when she came home, bringing loads of
laundry each time. Can’t wait for the washer and dryer also! My dad remains
close to home by his choosing.</p>

<p >The rest of both families are fine. My nephew
Bailey (Mark and Tobey’s oldest) is also a senior
looking into colleges. The littlest is
two year old Aviva, Jack and JoLouise’s.
Mark published a new book this summer. You can see his books, our construction
progress and all sorts of interesting Ancona things on line at <a
href="http://www.anconafamily.com/">www.anconafamily.com</a> as well as our
email addresses. Jim’s mother, Mary Ann
celebrated her 70<sup>th</sup> birthday in May. We all gathered in NJ for the
surprise party.  Both mothers are
on-line. We enjoy hearing from them. Jim’s grandmother developed heart trouble
on vacation in Florida last winter and had open-heart surgery back in New
Jersey. She has progressed remarkably and is back at the YMCA and cooked her
special stuffed mushrooms for Thanksgiving. She is amazing for ninety-one.</p>

<p >2003 looks busy. Tommy will graduate in the spring
and head off to college in the fall. Jim and I will both have our 25<sup>th</sup>
college reunions. My parents will celebrate their 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary. </p>


<p >Hoping all is well with you. We always look forward to hearing your news.
Blessings at Christmas and wishing you all the best in 2003.</p>

<p >With love, </p>
