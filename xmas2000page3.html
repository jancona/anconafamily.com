<p>The big news in the Fidler family is the newest member,
Aviva Hope. She was born a month early on Columbus Day to my brother Jack and
Jo Louise. Her two brothers seem pleased with their tiny sister, and my niece
Maggie is glad to finally have another girl in the family after all the boys.
My brother Mark has published two of his children’s books this fall. Pond
Puckster and Baseball Sleuth are sport related stories and are quite good. You
can read more about them and even find out where to purchase them at <a
href="http://www.markfidler.com/">www.markfidler.com</a>. Katherine and her
family are busy also. My father still is not feeling well, they have not
diagnosed him with anything that should slow him down this much, but he just
doesn’t have the energy and enthusiasm he had. It’s difficult for all of us,
especially my mother. Dad cancelled out of the Europe trip, but I’m really glad
Mom came along. We threw a surprise 70<sup>th</sup> birthday “girls day out”
party for Mom in November. She was so surprised. I can’t believe we pulled it
off. It was a good day. </p>

<p>Jim has updated our web page. He is planning to put some
pictures on, so if you are Internet accessible, check it out at
<a href='http://www.anconafamily.com'>http://www.anconafamily.com</a>! We’re thankful for our many friends and our
family. On behalf of all us, I wish you a joyous, blessed holiday and all the
best in 2001. </p>

With love,
