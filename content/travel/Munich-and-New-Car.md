# Day 1: Thursday

Our train arrived at Munich Hauptbahnhof (the main train station) at
just after 6 am. We decided to see if we could find coffee and
breakfast somewhere before walking to our
hotel. Our first
observation was that Munich is *not* an early rising town. We headed
out of the station and found that the nearby cafes didn't open until 7 and Burger
King not until 8. So we headed back into the station and found the
shopping section we'd missed the first time and there our breakfast
and coffee.

We arrived at
[Hotel Uhland](http://www.hotel-uhland.de/enwelcome.html) a bit after
7, and Brigitte at the desk couldn't have been nicer. While our room
wasn't ready (we hadn't expected it to be), she offered us a place to
sit and as we brushed our teeth and checked our email, she came back
to say that the person in our room had just checked out. It was made
up and ready to go by 8:30, so we were able to head up to shower and
change after our overnight train trip. Afterwards, we walked to the
city center to for a
[bike tour](https://www.mikesbiketours.com/munich/Bike-Tours/munich-sightseeing-tours-munich-guided-bike-tours-standard-bike-tour.html). The
tour gave us a good intro to the city. Our guide Tony, an American
expat married to a Bavarian girl, was a lot of fun as well as being a
source of information about the city and culture. The tour finished up
in the English Garden, where it was too cold for nude sunbathers, but
not too cold for beer and wursts at the Chinesischer Turm (Chinese Tower).

After the walk back, the long day and the trip the night before was
starting to catch up with us. We were looking for a quick bite nearby
and found it just around the corner at
[Speiselokal Lenz](http://www.speiselokal-lenz.de/), thanks to a
recommendation from the hotel desk. After dinner, we took a quick turn
through the Theresienwiese, the fairgrounds where Oktoberfest takes
place. Currently,
[Frühlingsfest (Springfest)](http://www.muenchen.de/veranstaltungen/event/7816.html),
"the little sister of Oktoberfest" as the website calls it, is running
there. The beer halls were packed on a cold Thursday night, but the
rest of the place was pretty quiet. We decided to stop back over the
weekend to check it out.

Even after less than 24 hours, some of the differences between Germany
and Italy were clear. In Italy, all traffic signal were treated as
purely advisory, and you crossed the street by holding up your hand
traffic cop style and hoping the drivers obey. It works, in that we
didn't get run over, but it's slightly nerve-wracking.

Here in Germany, it's different. While walking downtown, we arrived at
a minor intersection. The pedestrian crossing signal was red and there
were three or four young adults waiting for it to change. It
didn't. Instead we heard sirens in the distance. After a minute or
two, a couple of fire trucks went through but the light still didn't
change. No cars were going through the intersection, but no one
crossed. Finally after a total wait of perhaps five minutes, the
signal changed and everyone crossed. It could never have happened that
way in Rome or even Boston, but it seemed perfectly normal in Munich.

# Day 2: Friday

Delivery day dawned sunny and warmer than the day before. The hotel
buffet was great: a pot of good coffee, hard- and soft-boiled eggs,
assorted granolas and cereals, fruit and juice, and the highlight for
me, a great spread of cold cuts: sausages, cheese and vegetables. After
breakfast we bought a transit pass and caught the U-Bahn (subway) to
the Olympic Park.

We were there early, so we wandered through the site of the '72 games
geocaching, then took the elevator to the observation deck on the
Olympic Tower, 190 meters (over 600 feet) up. The view was nice, but
even though it was a clear day, it was too hazy to see the Alps in the
distance.

By the time we finished we had to rush to BMW Welt (BMW World) to
make our factory tour. The folks there checked us in and set us up for
the tour with a few minutes to spare. It was interesting to watch the
robots work--for large parts of the process, people are there mostly
to fix problems, while robots do all the routine work.

The tour was two hours. Afterwards we settled into the VIP lounge to
wait for our "delivery experience." (We elected not to try to squeeze
the BMW museum into the hour in between.) They had a buffet with
weisswurst (veal sausage), cold cuts, desserts, beer and soft
drinks. When it was time, Stefan, who handled our delivery, gave us an
overview of the car's features. We stood on a balcony overlooking
a special showroom area and watched the car arrive in an elevator,
then we walked down a curving ramp to see the car, which was rotating
slowly on a turntable! Quite the show!

After photos, Stefan took me through various features in the car, getting my phone
paired via Bluetooth, etc. Then it was time to leave. The first drive
was through rush hour traffic back to the hotel, which was slightly
nerve-wracking. As soon as we drove away I thought of five questions I
should have asked Stefan. I guess that's what the owner's manual is
for.

For dinner, we headed to the
[Augustiner Beer Hall](http://www.augustiner-restaurant.com/). The
biergarten outside was packed, so we headed inside to the beer
hall. There I had a mixed plate of German specialties. (The pig's
knuckle was superb!) Anne had a sliced beef dish that was also
tasty. I had a liter of beer, while Anne stuck to the half liter.

It was interesting people-watching in the beer hall. While there were
a number of tourists, the majority of diners appeared to be locals:
couples or small groups of friends, what appeared to be a bachelor
party and so forth. We see people in traditional Bavarian attire
(lederhosen, suspenders and felt hat for men, dirndl for women)
everywhere: out to dinner, at Frühlingsfest, walking down the
street. It was people of all ages. It seems to be an alternative
way to dress up, not a costume you wear twice a year to the folk
festival. A culture where eighteen year old boys wear lederhosen
non-ironically may be more alien to most Americans than one where
everyone waits for the Walk signal.

# Day 3: Saturday

After another good breakfast Saturday morning, we caught the tram to
Sendlinger Tor, then walked to
[Asamkirche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asamkirche,_Munich), a
rather astonishing baroque church. It's very small and was built by
two architect brothers as a private chapel and perhaps as a showroom
for future potential clients.

From there, we walked towards the center, stopping at the
[Frauenkirche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Frauenkirche). Most
of Munich's churches, indeed most of Munich, was heavily damaged in
the war and has been restored. Perhaps because of that, they don't
seem as old as they are.

We wandered around Munich, stopping at the
[Dallmayr Delicatessen](http://www.dallmayr.com/delicatessen/), then
heading to the Viktualienmarkt. It was packed with people, most of them
wearing red Bayern FC gear. They were playing Hertha from Berlin and there
were a few of their fans around too, dressed in blue. After strolling
around the shop and stalls for a while, we stopped in the biergarten
for beers and a fried half chicken. After stopping at another church,
we started towards the Residenze, the former palace, now a museum. But
I was too tired to face another couple of hours in a museum, so we
headed back to the hotel.

After a rest, we headed out to catch a Saturday vigil Mass, then try
to find some place to watch the rest of the game. In a coincidence
that may imply divine intervention, we chose the church in Munich that
was hosting the bishop for confirmation. For those who don't remember,
we also happened into a confirmation last week in Florence. This was a
big deal, with many being confirmed, a long homily and full choir. The music was
pretty good, although we were somewhat startled when they launched into
a hymn to the tune of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Last Supper" (Lyric:
"Look at all my trials and tribulations, Sinking in a gentle pool of
wine...") from *Jesus Christ Superstar*. The whole service went close
to two hours, so by the time it ended we figured the game would be
almost over. We headed back to or hotel, then back to Frühlingsfest to
grab dinner and a beer at the
[Hippodrom tent](http://www.hippodrom-fruehlingsfest.de/). Unfortunately,
there were long lines and it was raining, so we instead headed back to
Lenz, the place we ate Thursday night. Then, back to the
hotel. Tomorrow we head north in the new car!
