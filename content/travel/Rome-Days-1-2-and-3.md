So, we're three days into our visit and I haven't posted anything. I
plead exhaustion. Our trip was pretty uneventful, other than an hour
delay on the runway at Heathrow to resolve computer problems before
take-off on our leg to Rome.

# Day 1
We got to our
[hotel](http://www.hotelpaba.com/dove-siamo/) at around 3 pm. That was
about 18 hours after we left Boylston, with perhaps two or three hours of
sleep on the plane. The hotel room was very nice, but the wifi wasn't
working--they hoped to have it fixed later in the day.

After a bit of freshening up, we headed out. The plan was to pick up our Papal
Audience tickets for Wednesday, then head to the Spanish Steps to meet
our
[Twilight City Stroll & Gelato-Tasting](https://www.walksofitaly.com/rome-tours/welcome-rome-walking-tours)
tour. Things didn't go *quite* according to plan. First we need to get
money. The ATM across from our hotel didn't work, and it wasn't clear
whether the problem was with my card or the machine. There seemed to
be no other banks in the immediate vicinity and I wasn't eager to use
a stand-alone ATM at a Tabacchi (convenience store). I finally settled
on one at the Metro station. We headed off to pick up the tickets,
found the place without difficulty and had a short chat with the
priest and secretary at Santa Susannah before heading off to do Anne's
first geocache in Rome. It took a while to find, so by now it was
after 5 and our plan was to grab a quick snack before meeting our tour
at 7. I checked my email confirmation for details and realized I had
screwed up. I had convinced myself that the tour was at 7 when it was
actually at 5. We had missed it!

Since we hadn't eaten since "breakfast" on the plane hours before, we
decided to console ourselves with food and drink. We found a
likely-looking restaurant with outdoor seating and settled into a
couple of Mojitos (not very Italian), and what turned out to be a tasty steak
dish (I heard "carne" and decided that was good enough). While we ate,
I sent an email to the tour folks
([Walks of Italy](http://walksofitaly.com)) apologizing for my
screw-up and asking if we could reschedule. They were very
accomodating--by the end of the meal I was confirmed for the same tour
the next night.

After dinner we strolled to the nearest Metro stop to head back to our
hotel. The trains were packed with rush hour travellers. We managed to
squeeze in, and were followed by three teen-aged girls. I felt
something against my leg, reached down and brushed a hand. A minute
later I felt it again and brushed it away more emphatically. I checked
my pocket and found that the zippered inner pocket that held my
passport was partially open! Fortunately everything was still
there. The girls got off at the next stop.

We made it back to our hotel by 8. Anne was asleep by 8:30--I managed
to stay awake until almost 10.

*Days 2 and 3 to follow soon!*
