# Tentative Schedule
## Thursday April 30
Drive from Bacharach to Reutte, about 5 hours on the Autobahn. Arrive
at [Hotel das Beck](http://hotel-das-beck.at/) ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/xRGuc)).

## Friday May 1
Ludwig's castles, Füssen, drive the
[Deutsche Alpenstrasse](http://goo.gl/h3N2rF) towards Berchtesgaten.

## Saturday May 2
Tram up the Zugspitze. Some hiking based on recommendation from family
friend Mee'sha.

## Sunday May 3
Drive to [Bolzano, Italy](/travel/Bolzano). The shortest route is over Brenner Pass. We
may want to consider using Reschen Pass further west.
[Alternate routes](http://www.alpineroads.com/tyrol.php).

If we do take the Brenner Pass route, we may want to stop at
[Reifenstein Castle](http://goo.gl/maps/g1GzF) in Sterzing, just over the border in Italy.
