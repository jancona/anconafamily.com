# Tentative Schedule
## Sunday April 26
Leave Munich and drive the
[Romantic Road](http://www.romantischestrasse.de/index.php?id=erleben&L=0)
([map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zcH7qU2CLLP8.kr76zsSEji7k))
to Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Staying off the Autobahn, the trip is
about 4 hours of driving.  We should plan to arrive in time
to check in to the hotel, get dinner and then take the
[Might Watchman's Tour](http://www.nightwatchman.de/index.php?cat=182&cl2=182)
at 8 pm. Alternatively, we could eat afterwards.

We're staying at
[Hotel-Gasthof Goldener Greifen](http://www.gasthof-greifen-rothenburg.de/english.html)
([map](https://goo.gl/maps/PXeQu)). They have parking available and
free loaner bikes for guests!

## Monday April 27
Walk the town, visit sights, then drive to Bacharach, about three
hours on the Autobahn. In Bacharach, we're staying at the
[Hotel Kranenturm](http://kranenturm.com/bacharach-germany/index.html)
([map](https://goo.gl/maps/pG46q)).

## Tuesday April 28
Cruise the Rhine to Saint Goar and back--perhaps take the train one
way. The ferry dock is across the street from the hotel, the schedule
is [here](https://www.k-d.com/en/kd-scheduled-cruises/kd-rhine-timetable/).

## Wednesday April 29
Scenic drive along the Rhine and Moselle to Beilstein and Cochem. We'll be sure to
stop at [Burg Eltz](http://burg-eltz.de/en.html)
([map](https://goo.gl/maps/7uwtE)). We hope to catch up with family
friend Mee'Sha.
