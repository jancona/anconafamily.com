Internet access while travelling is pretty important to us--probably
more important than mobile phone service. All of the hotels we are
staying in advertise Wifi availability, but we'd really like to have
internet access on our phones, for things like navigation, as well as
posting to Facebook!

Both Anne and I have unlocked GSM phones that support European
frequencies. Our service at home is through T-Mobile, which offers
["free unlimited" international roaming](http://www.t-mobile.com/simple-choice-international-plans.html). The
"unlimited" is in quotes because it's throttled to 2G speeds unless
you pay quite a bit extra ($50 for 500 mb). But it turns out our plan
isn't eligible for it anyway and it's not a good enough deal to make
it worth upgrading.

Luckily, I found the
[Prepaid Data SIM Card Wiki](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data). While
the name doesn't roll off the tounge, it is filled with great
information about plans all over the world.

While I think of the European Union as being sort of a United States
of Europe, at least when it comes to travel and economic issues, the
cell phone industry there has elements of the US circa 1997. Each country
(think US state) has several providers, but once you cross a border
you're roaming at exorbitant rates. (The situation is starting to
change, so read on!) On the other hand, the rates in
each country are generally cheaper than here. For that reason, the
recommendation for travellers is generally to buy a cheap SIM in each
country you visit. I originally planned to do it that way, buying a
SIM when I got to [Rome](/travel/Rome-Planning). (It's impossible to buy and register an Italian
SIM from outside the country.) Then I'd buy another one when I got to
Germany and perhaps a third in Austria.

Luckily, I heard about
[Ortel Mobile's Cross Plan](http://www.ortelmobile.de/en/crosseurope.html)
[here](http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showpost.php?p=8944186&postcount=11). For
€20 a month they offer
[a plan](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/European_Union#Ortel_mobile_Germany_with_Cross_option)
with 300 minutes of calls and 750 MB of data that covers all the EU
countries plus Switzerland. The data can be topped
up with another 500 MB for €9.

A couple of weeks ago, I ordered one from an Ebay seller based in
Berlin. The package included the SIM card with a German phone number
written on the attached folder. With that in hand, I went to the Ortel
Mobile website (English version) and tried to activate the SIM. That
failed. I eventually figured out that the card had already been
activated. I was able to go to https://mein.ortelmobile.de/ and
register. Unfortunately they don't seem to have an English version of
that site so if you don't speak German, Chrome's auto-translate
function is your friend.

The steps to register were:

* Click on "Jetzt für MeinOrtel registrieren" (Register now for MyOrtel)
* Enter my phone number (Meine Rufnummer) and the PUK1 number from the materials I received, plus my email address.
* Click the "Registrierien" button.

They emailed me a temporary link to log in and change my password--my
phone number became the user name.

Once I logged in again, I was able to access the site, with options to
add a credit card or set up Paypal, purchase plans, etc (again all in
German). I didn't sign up for the Cross plan now, because it's only
good for a month, and I'm not leaving until mid-April. But I think I'm
good to go. I'm confident enough that I ordered another card for
Anne's phone.

I placed the card in the phone and it prompted me to unlock it with a
PIN. It turns out you need the PIN1 value printed on the plastic SIM
card holder. It eventually registered as roaming on AT&T. I tried
making a call but got a fast busy. I also tried calling the number
from my home phone, but that didn't go through either. I did notice
that my credit balance declined by one Euro after my fooling around,
so I don't recommend you try it before you get to Europe.

I'll update again once I get to Europe and try it for real, but if all
goes according to plan we will have working phones when we land in
London to change planes and for the rest of the trip. So if you're
travelling to Europe check out the
[wiki](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data). If
you're going to a single country, the best options are probably on
that country's page, while if you're moving around, check out the
[EU options](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/European_Union).
