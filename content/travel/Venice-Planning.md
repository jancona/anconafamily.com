# Tentative Schedule
## Tuesday April 21

Arrive late morning. We're staying at the
[Hotel Pensione Guerrato](http://www.pensioneguerrato.it/).
To get there we'll take the vaporetto (ferry) route 1 from the train
station to Rialto Mercato. From there it's a one minute walk to the
hotel. We may want to pay €25 for a 36 hour vaporetto pass, since
individual rides are €7.

Evening: [Alessandro Schezzini tour(s)](http://www.schezzini.it/index.php/features)
