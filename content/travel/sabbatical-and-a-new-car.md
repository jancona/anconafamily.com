I've been working at [Constant Contact](http://constantcontact.com)
since March of 2005. One cool benefit we have is a paid one month
sabbatical (in addition to regular vacation) after ten years of
service. Around the holidays last December it occurred to me that mine
was coming up and I ought to start thinking about how to spend it.

Anne and I have done only a little overseas travel. We went to Vienna, Budapest and
Prague in 2000 and a had a
[long weekend in London](/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=7864)
right before I started at
Constant Contact in 2005. But having a month seems like a perfect chance to do
some European travel before retirement. Anne has been at least
temporarily retired from paid employment for the last couple of years,
so we don't have to worry about time off for her.

For various reasons, Italy and Germany are the first two
countries on our list. Around the time I was thinking about this, I
remembered reading about *European Delivery*&mdash;buying a European
car and picking it up at the factory. I'd had my eye on the
[BMW 2 Series](http://www.bmwusa.com/standard/content/vehicles/2015/2/default.aspx)
for a while, so I looked into 
[BMW's program](http://www.bmwusa.com/Standard/Content/Explore/Experience/EuropeanDelivery/Default.aspx).
Turns out you can order a car through a US dealer, pick it up in
Munich, drive it for up to five months and drop it off at one of several
locations in various parts of Europe. BMW will then ship it to the US
and redeliver it to your dealer six to eight weeks later. Its a
US-spec car, and all the registration, insurance and shipping details
are taken care of as part of the program. Even better, the car costs
*less* than buying it normally. (If you don't count the cost of the
trip!)

So early in January we headed to a dealer for a test drive. Our first
test drive was a five mile loop with the salesman in the back
seat. When I asked the dealership for a longer test drive they told me
it wasn't possible. In the mean time I had been researching the car
and the program in online forums. The folks at
[Bimmerfest](http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/index.php) pointed me to
[Alex Dytko](mailto:ad@dytko.net) at
[BMW of Peabody](http://www.bmwpeabody.com/). Alex let us take a 228i
for a two hour test drive that sold us on the car. We negotiated a
reasonable deal and generally has made the process so far very
smooth. Here's the car I ordered:

I'll write more about trip planning soon.
