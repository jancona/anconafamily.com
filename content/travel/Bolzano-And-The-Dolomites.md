# Sunday: Ötzi

My [original plan](http://anconafamily.com/travel/Bolzano/) for the
drive to Italy was to make it into an all day scenic drive. But when
we woke up to another foggy, drizzly day, it seemed better to
just take the shortest route, and hope the weather was better on the
other side of the Alps. Anne wanted to get caches in three countries
on a single day. (It's hard to do that where we live.) So we headed
back to Füssen (in Germany), where she did a couple at the Lech River falls. Then
back to Reutte for an Austrian cache as we headed south.

We drove over Fernpaß towards central Austria, stopped for lunch in a
small town, then headed east to Innsbruck, where we turned south and
headed up into Benner Pass, the main connection between Austria and
Italy. Then downhill on the other side to Bozen/Bolzano. All the
geographic features in the area have both German and Italian
names. This area (the
[South Tyrol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino-Alto_Adige/S%C3%BCdtirol))
was part of the Austrian empire until after World War I, so it has a
lot in common with the other Tirolean areas to the north in
Austria. It's predominantly German-speaking, with Italian and
[Ladin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladin_language) (another Romance
language) as well.

As we neared Bolzano, we checked and realized that the
[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology](http://www.iceman.it/) was closed
on Mondays, so we decided to head to try to head there. After driving
in circles for a while, trying to get close to the museum while
avoiding the car exclusion zones that are ubiquitous in Italy, we
finally parked in a garage downtown and walked to the museum.

*Ötzi* (rhymes with curtsy) is a mummy found by alpine hikers
in 1991. At first they thought it was the victim of a mountaineering
accident a few years before. Eventually scientists determined that it
was actually  the remains of a man who died around 3300 BC. Along with
the well-preserved mummy, they also found lots of his clothing and
equipment at the site, making it a treasure-trove of information. And
to add to the mystery, it appears he was murdered! If you're
interested, the [museum site](http://www.iceman.it/) and the
[Ötzi Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi) have more
information.

The museum exihibits the actual mummy (through a window into a
climate-controlled chamber and which you're not allowed to
photograph), as well as most of the clothing and equipment, and the
reconstruction you see above. We really enjoyed our visit!

Anne found an Ötzi cache outside the museaum to complete her three
country trifecta, but she also wanted to get the oldest cache in
Italy, a few miles north of Bolzano. We decided to head there before
heading off to our lodgings in Kastelruth, about a 40 minute drive up
into the mountains. We followed a windy road through a bunch of
tunnels to end up
[parking here](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.522531,11.362193,3a,75y,76.97h,89.41t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sdSbCfsXzqaDypPAY1QsjQw!2e0!6m1!1e1)--the
cache was up that little road on the left. Since turning around was
problematic (think about cars coming out of that tunnel at 40 or 50
miles per hour), we ended up driving a few more miles up the road
before heading back tow Bolzano and then to our lodgings, an
*agriturismo* (farm B&B) called
[Tirlerhof](http://www.tirlerhof.it/en/).

The web site makes it look like a bigger place than it actually
was. It was actually a cozy room in a farmhouse with a balcony
overlooking an alpine meadow with a view of the Dolomites--if the
weather ever cleared. Frau Tirler spoke a bit of English, so between
that and my *bisschen Deutsch* we managed to communicate what we
needed.

We drove back into town for a
[pizza and a glass of wine](http://www.zuraltenschmiede.it/en/)--good!
I think we broke our cabbage streak (which had resumed after the
one day hiatus a few days ago) again--I'm pretty sure our salad
didn't include any. Our time in German-speaking areas is
almost over, so it had to end soon anyway.

# Monday: Kastelruth/Castelrotto

Monday morning dawned bright and--no wait a minute, it was cloudy and
foggy yet again. After a good breakfast at Tirlerhof, we headed into
town and did the walking tour in the Rick Steves book. The weather
hadn't improved much, but we decided to try some of the
[Dolomite loop drive](https://books.google.com/books?id=IEvnBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT368&ots=5Jes6exLes&dq=abbreviated%20dolomite%20loop%20drive&pg=PT368#v=onepage&q=abbreviated%20dolomite%20loop%20drive&f=false)
anyway. We made it to the top of Sella Pass, elevation 2240 meters,
7347 feet. There were some views, but the tops of the mountains were
in the clouds, and the dramatic, bare rock tops are the best part of
the Dolomites. To get an idea of what we were missing, compare
[this picture](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.513727,11.76566,3a,75y,277.3h,89.14t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s_TPvRTn7xmInKnr0ADIJIQ!2e0)
with some of mine below.

After some photos and geocaches at the top of the pass, we elected to
head back down the way we came. We were only one third of the way
around the loop, which would have taken us all the way down to Bolzano
before getting back to Kastelruth. So we got back to Tirlerhof
mid-afternoon and took it easy. I tried to catch up on my blogging and
since we had no wifi, Anne took a nap.

When I asked about wifi when we arrived, Frau Tirler made a phone call
and two minutes later her son showed up carrying a router--voila, we
had internet! Evidently he had reclaimed it during the day, and I
didn't bother to try to get it back. This was the latest, but not the
last of our issues with hotel internet on the trip. Maybe I'll do a
separate post/rant about it at some point.

Tuesday morning was slightly clearer, enough that we could see some of
the view from our balcony that we had missed up 'til now. It was
supposed to turn into a warm, sunny day, but we weren't able to see
it. We were off to Tuscany!
