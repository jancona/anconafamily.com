# Tuesday: Arrival at La Montalla

It was a long drive (over 500 km/300 miles) to [La Montalla](http://lamontalla.com/?lang=en), our
agriturismo in Tuscany. Since most of it was on the autostrada, we got
to experience sticker shock at Italian tolls--over 30 Euros due
when we got off. We arrived around 3 pm, only to encounter a note that
seemed to say (it was in Italian) that someone would be back at
3:30. So we decided to check out Contignano, the town nearby. In
truth, there wasn't too much to check out--a small village with
narrow streets, a church, and very little open. It did have an ATM
and, down the street, a combined *piscina* (swimming pool)/bar with no water in
the pool. We finished our explorations and when we got back, Alphonso, the
owner's son had arrived to check us in.

We hadn't eaten much for lunch, so after getting settled we decided to
head to Montepulciano, about 10 miles away, for dinner. Forty scenic minutes
(15 of them on a gravel road) later, we had gotten our first lesson in
Tuscan geography, that every trip takes at least twice as long as you
would think.

Montepulciano, like many Tuscan towns, is a walled medieval city
located on top of a hill. "On top of a hill" perhaps gives the wrong impression
because it implies that once you've arrived there, you too are on top
of a hill. In reality, Montepulciano *encompasses* the top of the
hill. This distinction turns out to be important.

We parked just outside one of
the gates and walked in and up. We walked up and browsed some
shops. We walked up some more and Anne found a geocache. By now it was
after 6 and we were getting pretty hungry. We walked back down to near
the gate where we had entered to a restaurant that Alphonso at our hotel
had recommended. Unfortunately, it wasn't open yet. Somewhere on our
drive south we had re-entered the part of Italy where restaurants
don't open until 7:30 pm (and only tourists eat for at least an hour
after that).

So we walked up again (everything was uphill from that gate)
eventually ending up at the main square at the real top of the
hill. There we found a Rick Steves recommended restaurant,
[Osteria Del Conte](http://www.osteriadelconte.it/?lang=en) where,
once 7:30 rolled around, we had a great dinner. After dinner, we
walked (all downhill) back to the car and then home to bed.

# Wednesday: Orvieto

Wednesday morning we decided to head to
[Orvieto](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/orvieto-what-an-italian-hill-town-should-be). Taking
the more scenic route along route SR2 seemed to be only a few minutes
longer than taking the autostrada, so we opted for that. After driving
a half hour or so, we came to a barrier--the highways was
closed. There was no obvious indication of for how long, or of
alternate routes. Google Maps offered a route up into the hills that
rejoined the highway further down, but we were reluctant to take it
without knowing how far the closed section extended. So we turned
around and drove back to the autostrada, turning what what supposed to
be a one hour trip into two-plus hours.

Once we got there Orvieto was very nice. We really liked the colorful
exterior of the cathedral as well as Luca Signorelli's frescoes in the
Chapel of San Brizio. The museum behind the cathedral also had some
nice pieces, including the marble Mary and Child you see in the
pictures below. All in all it was a nice day. While there were
tourists around, nothing was crowded, with the most obvious groups
being Italian schoolkids, apparently on field trips.

We ended up eating dinner at
[Dopolavoro La Foce](http://www.dopolavorolafoce.it/) a nice
*ristorante* not far from our hotel, after first trying an even closer
one in Contignano, but finding it closed.

# Thursday: Assisi

Anne put out an Assisi versus Siena call on Facebook. While there were
votes for both, we ended up choosing Assisi. Before we left we did a
load of laundry in La Montalla's (free!) washing machine and Anne hung
it out.

We tried the scenic,
non-highway route today as well, with somewhat better luck (no
detours), but the route wasn't actually all that scenic. We parked in
an underground garage at the top of the town, so it was literally all
downhill from there. We had a Rick Steves audio tour that took us
through many sights in the town. We saw people preparing for some sort
of festival, which turned out to be
[Calendimaggio](http://www.amoitaly.com/assisi/calendimaggio.html), a
Spring festival. As we ate lunch, they were setting up stands outside
the Temple of Minerva and we considered staying to watch the
festivities, but it sounded like you needed tickets, plus Anne really
wanted to see the Basilica of St. Francis. So we finished our
afternoon there following another audio tour.

At this point we were about a mile and several hundred feet of
elevation from the car. So we sprang for a cab back up the hill before
making our way back to Contignano where Anne took in the laundry
before we headed out to the local restaurant (the one that was closed
last night) for a good dinner.

# Friday: Tuscany

We had been staying in Tuscany for two days, but both of our
destinations (Orvieto and Assisi) had been in the neighboring province
of Umbria. So we decided to make Friday our Tuscany day, following a
loop around the
[Val d'Orcia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_d%27Orcia), the scenic
region we were staying in.

We started out be heading to
[Rocca d'Orcia](http://www.valdorcia-info.com/rocca_dorcia.htm) a
hilltop fortress with great 360 degree views. From there we headed a
few kilometers north to
[Bagno Vinoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagno_Vignoni) a village
with hot springs that have been used as baths since Roman
times. Besides wandering through the town, we ate lunch and searched
for a geocache at the ruins of a grist mill at the edge of town that
had been powered by the overflow from the springs.

Next stop was
[San Quirico d'Orcia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Quirico_d%27Orcia),
another scenic walled hilltop town with a couple of nice churches and
a geocache! From there we headed to
[Pienza](http://www.italia.it/en/travel-ideas/unesco-world-heritage-sites/pienza-the-ideal-city.html),
which was designed to be the ideal Renaissance city, at the behest of
Pope Pius II. We enjoyed the piazza and Duomo, as well as
artichoke-and-ginger gelato at
[BuonGusto](https://www.facebook.com/BuonGustoGelateriaPienza).

We decided to finish our day in Montepulciano, seeing a bit more of
the town and getting dinner there. We were ready for the hills and
enjoyed touring the cellars at
[Contucci Cantina](http://www.contucci.it/en/), and seeing the
late-afternoon views of the countryside. Anne wanted one more
Tuscan steak before we left Tuscany. We had neglected to get a
reservation at the place we wanted to go, but ended up having a good
one at another restaurant.

# Conclusion

We left Saturday morning for Cinque Terre. We had thought about
stopping in Lucca on the way, but decided that we'd rather have the
afternoon in Cinque Terre.

I grossly underestimated how long it takes to get from place to place
in rural Tuscany. The distances on the map aren't large, but the roads
(other than the autostrada) are narrow and windy, to the point that
the village you see on the next hilltop is often half an hour or more
away. While I liked the rural setting and scenery at La Montalla, it
compounded the problem, because everything was a drive from there. The
end results was that while we enjoyed everything we did, we didn't get
to many of the places we would have liked to see because they were
just too far away.

While I liked staying in one place for four nights, if/when we go to
Tuscany again, I think I'd plan to stay two or three 
nights in a few strategically located towns with side trips into the
nearby countryside. An agriturismo that offered dinner or an apartment
with kitchen facilities might be another option.
