# Sunday: Munich to Rothenburg
After another good breakfast we bid "Auf Wiedersehen" to Munich and
Hotel Uhland. This hotel was the highlight of our trip so far, with a
great breakfast, friendly and helpful staff and convenient
services. (They did a load of laundry for us for 12 Euro. We spent 8
Euro to do it ourselves at a laundromat in Florence.)

I used the
[Michelin Navigation app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viamichelin.android.michelintraffic&hl=en)
to select a scenic route to Augsburg, where we picked up the
[Romantische Straße (Romantic Road)](http://www.romantischestrasse.de/index.php?id=erleben&L=0),
a scenic route that wends its way from Würzburg down to Füssen in the
Alps.  Here's a
[map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zcH7qU2CLLP8.kr76zsSEji7k)
of the Romantische Straße--it's the North-South red line. We
traveled the middle part of it, from Augsburg up to Rothenburg (just
west of Nürnburg, you have to zoom in to see it). The
drive to Augsburg was pleasant--a short stretch on the autobahn,
followed by some scenic back roads the rest of the way there. I had
the car up to about 90 mph for a short while on the highway, and the
rest of the drive was pleasant once I figured how speed limits worked.

On secondary roads between towns, the default speed limit is 100 kph
(62 mph). When you hit an orange town limits sign, the limit drops to
50. As you leave town, the back of the orange sign (so it's on the
left this time) has then town name with a red slash across it. That
means that you can resume 100 kph. Of course any of this can be
overridden by explicit speed limit signs. The overridden limits show
when they end with another speed limit sign with a grey slash across
it. Very logical, but took a bit of figuring out.

We had a bit of trouble finding the Romantic Road out of Augsburg, but
when we did we were following a winding two-lane highway that made a
point of going through each village along the way. After driving a
while we came to Harburg, a pleasant village with a massive stone
bridge and a castle perched on the hill above it. We stopped to
stretch our legs and take a few pictures. A few kilometers out of town,
we came to a scenic overlook that also hosted a geocache. So we
stopped again and took a short walk up to a stone outcrop with
commanding views.

Our next stop was Nördlingen, a town with a complete wall ringing the
city. We grabbed a quick lunch, then wandered through the church, did
an Earth cache and walked a section of the wall.

Then we continued on to
Rothenburg, arriving just before 6 pm. We parked in a lot outside of
town and walked to our hotel, the
[Goldener Greifen](http://www.gasthof-greifen-rothenburg.de/english.html).
When I checked in, the receptionist
assured me that they had parking in the back of the hotel. She gave me
the address and marked it on a map. I walked back up to the car while
Anne settled into the room. I programed the parking address into
Google maps and drive through the gate in the wall and into
Rotenburg. Driving through the streets, dodging cafe tables and
tourist, the streets got steadily narrower as I approached my
destination. Finally I saw a courtyard entrance that looked likely. I
pulled in--no parking spaces available, so I parked blocking a garage
entrance. I walked up to a waitress smoking a cigarette and asked if I
was in the right place. No, she told me, I was in the courtyard of the
restaurant next door to my hotel. I should pull head out and around
the corner to the left. I backed out (no room to turn around) and
realized I couldn't go left (no room to turn around in that
direction), so I headed right. The next right headed to a main road
where the map said I could circle around to my destination, so I
headed that way. The street rapidly got narrower, to the point where I
was expecting my mirrors to start scraping the buildings on either
side. In addition, Rothenburg has lots of cornerstones protruding into
the streets, originally to prevent wagons from chipping the
buildings' paintwork. Presumably they also work on BMW's five centuries
later.

Here's a picture of the street I came down (in my 3 day old car)!

After making it through there without scrapes, it was a relative easy
trip to around the block to the correct courtyard.

We grabbed dinner at our hotel and finished in time for the
[Night Watchman's Tour](http://www.nightwatchman.de/index.php?cat=147&cl2=141&cl3=147&sprache=ENG).
Georg, the
watchman, does a combination historical tour/stand-up act for all comers
every evening at 8. On this Sunday night in April, "all comers" added
up to 50 or so people. At 7 Euro a head, he's got a pretty good gig
going! The hour-long tour was interesting and a lot of fun--well worth
the money.

# Monday: Rothenburg

Before breakfast Anne headed out to do a
[webcam](http://www.tourismus.rothenburg.de/index.php?id=481) cache in the market
square, while I stayed in the room to capture her image. Another good
breakfast--Germany works much better for my attempts to stay low-carb
than Italy did. We did another Rick Steves audio tour. This one
duplicated some of the information in the night watchman's tour, but
did take us some new places. Along the way we stopped to climb the
tower at the old Rathaus (town hall). It was a beautiful day, with
great views from the top! We had expected hordes of tourists, but the
numbers were limited, and as soon as we left the main streets and
squares things were quiet.

We grabbed lunch at a cafe, the wandered and cached a bit more
(without success), then headed out around 3 pm for the three hour
drive to our next stop, Bacharach, along the Rhine west of Frankfurt.
