It's the end of our second day in Florence. Time flies when your
having fun! We're back in our room relatively early for once--it's
only 9:15. Last night at this time we hadn't started dinner yet! And
we're listening to the Red Sox broadcast, streaming on the Internet,
since they're playing a day game today.

Florence is less overwhelming than Rome. It's much smaller and very
walkable--everything is close together and the narrow streets keep
speeds under control. It's also more "touristy." And the tourists here
seem to be mostly American (or Japanese), while in Rome they were
equally likely to be speaking English, French, German, Spanish or some language I
didn't recognize. On the other hand, the selfie stick  and
flower sellers here aren't ubiquitous and seem less aggressive.

# Day 1: Saturday
We got here yesterday on the high-speed train. At 150 mph, it was a
quick and easy trip. The
[Dei Mori B&B](http://www.deimori.it/firenze/) is in a great location
just south of the Duomo and a 15 minute walk from the train
station. We got settled in our room then headed out to get lunch. We
went to Il Gatto e la Volpe a casual restaurant near our hotel. The
pizza and salad were great, but it took a while to get the check,
almost making us late for our
[Vasari Corridor and Uffizi Gallery Tour](http://www.florencetown.com/103-vasari-corridor-uffizi-tour.html). Our
guide Mario Gesu was great, memorizing everyone's name and running the
tour like a Socratic-method seminar on Medieval and Renaissance
art. The downside was the crowds, which were massive and noisy. We had
headsets, but the quality wasn't great and it was hard to even get a
good view in some of the rooms. Once we moved to the Vasari Corridor
there were no more crowds, but the art was less interesting--a lot of
baroque and neo-classical portraits. I'm glad we took the tour, since
we would have been lost without it. But I told Anne that we should come
back in January some year to visit the museums.

The [Vasari Corridor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasari_Corridor)
connects the Palazzo Vecchio, the Florence town hall, with the Palazzo
Pitti, a Medici palace on the other side of the river, running across
the Ponte Vecchio along the way. As we headed back to the bridge after
the tour, we passed the
[chiesa di Santa Felicita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Felicita,_Florence). (We
had actually seen into the church from the corridor, because the
Medicis had their own entrance into the church balcony from the
corridor. Mass was just starting, so we slipped into a back pew--the
church was packed. We soon realized that we were at a confirmation,
with the bishop celebrating. We couldn't see much, but the choir was
very good!

Back at the hotel, I worked on photos and blog posting from the Rome
part of the trip, then we went out for at late dinner.

# Day 2: Sunday

After breakfast at our B & B, I continued to catch up on photos and
blog posts--finally finished Rome! While I did that, Anne went out to
do some geocaching in the area. Just before noon we headed out to grad
a quick lunch before our
[Accademia/David tour](http://www.florencetown.com/167-accademia-gallery-florence-tour.html)
at 1. Anne had seen a group of Italian cyclists getting lunch at a
little shop around the corner from our B & B, so we picked up
sandwiches there and ate as we walked to our tour rendezvous. Our tour
group ended up being an all-Massachusetts affair, with us, a couple
from Bellingham and a family of six (4 kids aged 8 to 15) from
Concord.

David was spectacular and the crowds were much more manageable than at
the Uffizi the day before. After the guided part of the tour ended, we
spent another hour or so looking at the other sculpture and paintings
there. Then we wandered to the Mercato Central (central market) and
grabbed beers and watched the people go by. I also picked up a sausage
to supplement our carb-laden breakfasts.

Some more geocaching on the way back to the hotel. Then we headed out
to wash clothes at a laundromat down the street and grabbed an early
light dinner (appetizer, salad and pizza) at Il Gatto e la Volpe
again.
