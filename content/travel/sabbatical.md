I've been working at [Constant Contact](http://constantcontact.com)
since March of 2005. One cool benefit we have is a paid one month
sabbatical (in addition to regular vacation) after ten years of
service. Around the holidays last December it occurred to me that mine
was coming up and I ought to start thinking about how to spend it.
