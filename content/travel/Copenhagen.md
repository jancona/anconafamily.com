As part of their Overseas Delivery program, Volvo is paying for round trip flights between Boston and Gothenburg, Sweden for Anne and me. SAS had a connection through Copenhagen, so we arranged to have a layover for a few days. We were in Premium Economy with extra legroom, wifi, upgraded meals and free booze. The only downside was that the flight left early, at 5:30. By the time I finished messing with the blog and decided to try to rest it was getting close to 11 Boston time. I had barely closed my eyes when they turned up the lights to serve breakfast! We were on the ground in Copenhagen before 6:30 am local time. We took the Metro into the city and had a fairly short walk to the <a href="http://hotel-bethel.dk/index.php/en/">Hotel Bethel</a>. (It's lucky the walk was fairly short, since pulling our suitcases over the cobblestone sidewalks was no fun.)

## Saturday

Our room wasn't ready, so we had a cup of coffee, stored our bags and headed out to explore. We were staying in Nyhavn ("New Harbor"). We walked a half mile or so to the meeting place for a <a href="http://historytours.dk/cms/index.php/en">walking tour</a> we wanted to take. We grabbed breakfast in the square, then met our guide Christian for an interesting time exploring <em> Hans Christian Andersen's Copenhagen</em>. After the tour we headed back to the hotel. Our room was ready! We showered and rested for an hour, then headed out for a late lunch and Mass. Then back to the hotel for a bit, dinner and, after 34 hours without sleep, bed! 

Here's an outline of the rest of our Copenhagen stay. I'll try to come back and fill it in later.
