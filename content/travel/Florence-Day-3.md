We've been here almost a week and the weather has been terrific. The
only rain was a sprinkle as we arrived in Florence on
Saturday. Yesterday (Sunday) was cool, with highs in the 50's. The
Florentines were bundled up, but we were comfortable in jackets. Today
was glorious--bright sunshine and highs in the mid 70's.

# Day 3: Monday

So it's official, we didn't allow enough time for Florence, or I
didn't plan it effectively, or both. It's 6 pm on our last day here
and we feel like we haven't scratched the surface.

This morning we headed to the
[Musei San Marco](http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/en/musei/index.php?m=sanmarco)
which has works by the early Renaissance painters Fra Angelico and
Fra Bartolomeo. The museum is housed in the former Dominican convent
of San Marco, where the painters lived. The ground floor exhibits
mostly illuminated altarpieces and other "formal" works. For me, the
real treasure was upstairs, where Fra Angelico painted frescos in the
monks' cells. They're very well-preserved, and they are beautiful!

We walked back to our hotel, grabbing a sandwich and a cup of wine,
which we ate sitting on the hotel balcony. We then headed out again
and did part of a Rick Steves walking audio tour of the area before
our
[bike tour](http://www.florencetown.com/40-i-bike-florence-tour.html)
at 3 o'clock. It was a lot of fun. In addition to seeing the city
center, which we had already walked through, we crossed the river and
got to areas where we hadn't been on foot. I wish we had taken the
bike tour the first day--it would have been a good orientation to the
city and we might have tried to do some different things because of
it. The other thing I definitely would have done differently was to
try to get to the Uffizi early in the day. We were somewhat
constrained because we we in town from midday Saturday to Tuesday
morning and most museums are closed on Monday. So an extra day would
have helped a lot.

Our last night was highlighted by a great dinner at
[Simon Boccanegra](http://www.boccanegra.com/en). We had our chance to
try the famous Tuscan steak, and it exceeded high expectations! Anne
said it was the best steak she ever had.

# Day 4: Tuesday

Since we had missed seeing the interior of the Duomo, we got up early
on Tuesday and went to 7:30 mass. There were only about 15 people
there and it was a quick service--no homily. But three nuns did sing
an opening piece and we joined in on the Alleluia. We did wander
through the basilica and admire the dome for a few minutes before
heading back to our B & B to eat breakfast and pack.

Since we were early for our train to Venice, we stopped in [Piazza
Santa Maria Novella](http://www.visitflorence.com/florence-monuments/piazza-santa-maria-novella.html). We
tried to tour the church, but they didn't allow luggage inside, so we
settle for having espresso and a crepe from a market stand in the
piazza. Then off to the train station and Venice!
