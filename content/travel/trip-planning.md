After quite a bit of research and discussion, we have at least the
outline of a plan for the
[trip](/travel/sabbatical-and-a-new-car/). Originally, my thought was
to pick up the car in Munich, drive south through Austria to Venice, then on to Rome
and Florence, making stops in the countryside (Umbria and Tuscany)
along the way. Then head back up through Switzerland to Germany and
finish our sightseeing there before dropping the car back in Munich
and flying home.

The things I didn't like about that plan were the amount of driving
and bringing my new car to Rome, Florence and Venice where it would
just be a hassle. Instead, we decided to fly into Rome and do the
three Italian cities at the beginning of the trip by train. We will
then take an overnight train from Venice to Munich to pick up the car.

The rest of the trip will be by car, through Germany, Austria and
Italy before dropping the car off in Nice, France and heading home. So
we'll do the big cities by train without the hassle of parking,
low-emission zones and city driving. We'll have the car to visit the
smaller towns and to see the countryside. And by dropping the car off
in Nice we reduce the around of driving.

Here's the outline:
