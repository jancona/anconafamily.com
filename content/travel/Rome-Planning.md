We arrive at about noon. We will take the
[Leonardo Express](http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=dd2aeb82a8fbf310VgnVCM1000008916f90aRCRD)
from the [airport](http://www.adr.it/web/aeroporti-di-roma-en-/pax-fco-fiumicino)
to the [Rome Termini](http://www.romatermini.com/en/) station. We will
probably want to buy SIM cards at either the airport or the
station. It appears that all the cell providers have
[shops](http://www.romatermini.com/en/store/index/hi-tech) at
Termini. [More on SIM cards and internet](/travel/internet).

We are staying at [Hotel Paba](http://www.hotelpaba.com/dove-siamo/),
about a
[15 minute walk](https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Termini,+Rome,+Italy&daddr=Via+Cavour,+266,+00184+Roma,+Italy&hl=en-US&sll=41.893626,12.489727&sspn=0.042871,0.074587&geocode=Fc1ZfwIdBMe-ACE40E6Bc9qzMilVR0Xco2EvEzE40E6Bc9qzMg%3BFfo-fwId_5O-ACnBFXRfsWEvEzEFZf5SR00YRg&oq=Rome+Ter&gl=US&dirflg=w&mra=ltm&t=m&z=16)
from Rome Termini.

### Places to go and things to do

Rick Steves on
[things to do in Rome](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/planning-your-time-in-rome):

> On the first day, do the “Caesar Shuffle” from the Colosseum to the
> Forum, then over Capitoline Hill to the Pantheon. After a siesta,
> join the locals strolling from Piazza del Popolo to the Spanish Steps.
> On the second day, see Vatican City (St. Peter’s, climb the dome,
> tour the Vatican Museum). Have dinner on the atmospheric
> Campo de’ Fiori, then walk to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish
> Steps. With a third day, add the Borghese Gallery (reservations
> required) and the Capitoline Museums.

[Vatican Museum](http://mv.vatican.va): Thursday or Friday and afternoons may be less
crowded. Buy tickets or book a tour in advance. [Official tours](http://biglietteriamusei.vatican.va/musei/tickets/do?action=booking&codiceLivelloVisita=4&step=1)

[Papal Audience](http://www.papalaudience.org/): Wednesday April 15,
10:30am (arrive early for a good seat). Order tickets from
[the Church of Santa Susanna](http://www.santasusanna.org/popeVatican/tickets.html) approximately
two weeks in advance.

[Ostia Antica](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/ostia-antica-near-rome)
“just 30 minutes from the Colosseum, offers ancient thrills to rival
Pompeii.”
