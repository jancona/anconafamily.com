# Tentative Schedule
## Tuesday April 14

We arrive at about noon. We will take the
[Leonardo Express](http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=dd2aeb82a8fbf310VgnVCM1000008916f90aRCRD) from
the [airport](http://www.adr.it/web/aeroporti-di-roma-en-/pax-fco-fiumicino) to the
[Rome Termini](http://www.romatermini.com/en/) station. I originally
thought that we would want to buy SIM cards at either the airport or
the station. It appears that all the cell providers have [shops](http://www.romatermini.com/en/store/index/hi-tech) at
Termini. But I was able to purchase cards and activate them in
advance, so this shouldn't be necessary. [More on SIM cards and internet](/travel/internet).

We are staying at [Hotel Paba](http://www.hotelpaba.com/dove-siamo/), about a
[15 minute walk](https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Termini,+Rome,+Italy&daddr=Via+Cavour,+266,+00184+Roma,+Italy&hl=en-US&sll=41.893626,12.489727&sspn=0.042871,0.074587&geocode=Fc1ZfwIdBMe-ACE40E6Bc9qzMilVR0Xco2EvEzE40E6Bc9qzMg%3BFfo-fwId_5O-ACnBFXRfsWEvEzEFZf5SR00YRg&oq=Rome+Ter&gl=US&dirflg=w&mra=ltm&t=m&z=16)

# Places to go and things to do

Rick Steves on
[things to do in Rome](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/planning-your-time-in-rome):

> On the first day, do the “Caesar Shuffle” from the Colosseum to the Forum, then over Capitoline Hill to the
> Pantheon. After a siesta, join the locals strolling from Piazza del Popolo to the Spanish Steps.  On the second day,
> see Vatican City (St. Peter’s, climb the dome, tour the Vatican Museum). Have dinner on the atmospheric Campo de’
> Fiori, then walk to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. With a third day, add the Borghese Gallery (reservations
> required) and the Capitoline Museums.

an aggregator/booking site owned by Tripadvisor.
