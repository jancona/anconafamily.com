This blog hasn't seen any updates in over four years, but as I write this, Anne and I are on a flight to Copenhagen to begin a two week trip to Scandinavia. The planning for this trip was less extensive than for our trip four years ago, but we're still hoping for a good time! Once again we're picking up a car--this time it's Anne's new Volvo XC40, so we're picking it up in Gothenburg, Sweden.

More to come later--this is basically a test post as I make sure I can resurrect the blog. It turns out the Google Photos has broken the technique I used to display my photos. So I had to come up with a new way to host and publish photos. At some point I will also have to fix the photos from our last trip.
