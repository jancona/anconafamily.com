# Rome Day 3

We're in Florence and here I am just starting on Rome days 3
and 4. I'll try to get better at this. I think leaving Rome will
help. Rome is so huge and bustling, that you're tempted to always do
one more thing, because there's always one more great thing to do and
you can't possibly do them all--especially in four days.

Well, life is trade-offs, and we had to make one on Thursday. We had
originally planned to go to the Colosseum and Forum on Wednesday afternoon, then
take the train to
[Ostia Antica](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/ostia-antica-near-rome)
on Thursday morning to see more Roman ruins. (Ostia Antica is sort of
a mini-Pompeii, just a half-hour train ride from Rome. But we didn't
manage to get to the Colosseum on Wednesday so we decided to go
Thursday morning instead. The Colosseum is just a short walk from our
hotel, so we ran the gauntlet of selfie-stick sellers and fake
gladiators to start there. We used our Roma Pass to skip the ticket
lines and listened to a
[Rick Steves audio tour](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/italy)
on our phones to get a sense of the history and what went on here. The
Steves audio tours are much like the TV show--lots of good
information and a bit hokey. They're not as good as a well-done guided
tour, but they're way better than trying to go it alone with just a
book, and they're free!

While there were lots of people, the Colosseum is *big*, so I never
felt claustrophobic or jostled. From there, we made our way across the
street to the Forum. We did another audio tour there. One point it 
made was that the population of Rome dropped from over a million at
its peak during the empire to as low as 30,000 during the Middle
Ages. I found myself wondering what those few people, living in the
ruins of imperial splendor only a few generations later, thought of
what had come before.

After the Forum, we walked back to our hotel, stopping in Monti for
lunch. After a rest, we walked to
[Isola Tiberina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber_Island) to do a
geocache, then to dinner at
[Osteria Ponte Sisto](http://www.osteriapontesisto.com/), where we had
some great saltimbocca (veal topped with prosciutto).

# Rome Day 4

We were up very early to do a "beat the crowds" [tour of the Sistine
Chapel and Vatican Museum](https://www.walksofitaly.com/vatican-tours/pristine-sistine-chapel-tour). We
left the hotel by 6:40 and made it to the meeting place 10 minutes
early, enough time to have a cappuccino before starting. Our guide
Maria was fantastic and we got to spend a half hour in the chapel with
a limited number of people. Any commentary from me would superfluous,
so I'll refrain, but I really enjoyed it. We then toured other parts
of the museum, which has something like six miles of corridors, so the
tour had an unavoidable whirlwind quality. In addition, the crowds in
the museum by now were huge. In places it was hard to move around.

We finished up back in the Sistine Chapel, which was now much more
crowded. We then took the "back door" which brought us to the entrance
to St. Peter's, having skipped the security line, which wrapped three
quarters of the way around the square! The interior of St. Peter's was
awe-inspiring. Our guided tour ended outside of St. Peter's, so we
listened to another Rick Steves audio tour. It emphasized how much the
architecture tried to make it seem smaller than it actually is. For
example the statues higher up the pillars are larger than those below,
which makes them look the same size from the floor, rather than
perspective making them seem far away.

After eating lunch, we headed towards the Metro, intending to head to
Borghese Gardens (a large park) to spend a couple hours taking it easy
before our Borghese Gallery tour at 5. Unfortunately, the fates (in
the guise of the Rome transport workers union) intervened. The Metro
had gone on strike. Evidently this is a regular occurrence, scheduled
in advance, but we had missed the memo. In this case, the strike was
from 8:30 am to 6:30 pm--convenient for commuters, but not for
us. Buses and trams were still running and, thanks to transit
directions in Google Maps, we figured out how take a tram to near the
gallery.

We arrived early enough for Anne to do a few geocaches on our walk
through the gardens, and to meet geocachers from Slovakia
and Germany while doing so.

The Borghese Gallery was wonderful--the highlight so far for me.
They require reservations, and
strictly limit the number, so the experience was much better than at
many of the other museums we've visited. We rented the audioguide,
which I'd highly recommend. The museum is divided into rooms, and the
commentary focuses on one or two items in each--just the thing for
people like us who aren't knowledgeable about these things. The
sculptures on the first floor were the highlight (especially some of
the Berninis, like *Apollo and Daphne*), but there were a
number of paintings we liked in the Pinocateca upstairs. The
reservation limits your visit to two hours and it was possible to go
through the whole museum in that time, although it certainly would
have been possible to spend more.

We made it back to our hotel by eight (the Metro was running again)
and ate a quick but good dinner at Da Valentino, a local place across
the street from our hotel. This was our last day in Rome--we had to
leave for Florence in the morning.

In retrospect, we were overly optimistic about how much we could see
in four days, but the positive was we adjusted on the fly and managed
to see and do lots of things without killing ourselves. And, we have a
list of things to do on future trips.
