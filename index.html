<p>I work as a hospice nurse at
<a
 href="http://www.umassmemorial.org/ummhc/hospitals/med_center/services/hospice/hospice.cfm"
 >UMassMemorial Home Health and Hospice</a>.
 The commute is very easy. The office is this side of Worcester,
 about 5 miles from home&#8212;though some days I put on 70 miles. I listen to books on tape
 enroute to my visits and 'read' a book a week. I am a per-diem nurse, working
 when needed&#8212;which is all the time! I enjoy
 hospice nursing, helping make a difficult time better for patients and their
families. I take call overnight at least once a week. </p>

<p>I am still involved in Parish Nurse Ministries, Inc., a not for profit
Christian organization established to promote the concept of Parish Nursing. I
just handed over the reins of newsletter editor! I try to attend meetings when
I am not working. There is a lot of information on Parish Nursing 
<a
 href="http://www.parishnurses.org/">here</a> or 
<a
 href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Health/Nursing/Specialties/Community_Health/Parish/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>I am still a board member of <a href="http://www.koinoniaofvermont.org/">Koinonia
of Vermont</a>, a retreat house in Southern Vermont. Among other things, I
plan their Parish Nurse yearly retreat. We are going to offer bereavement
retreats and retreats for nurses. A big plus for me is the worship opportunity
at nearby Weston Priory. If you want to know more about Koinonia of Vermont you
can see their web site at 
<a href="http://www.koinoniaofvermont.org/">http://www.koinoniaofvermont.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>I am a member of the Commission for Women of the Diocese of Worcester. We
planned a womens conference attended by over 400 women this fall. It is fun and
rewarding, I'm vice chairperson this year and enjoy working with a wonderful
group of faith filled women.</p>

<p>Jim and I still sing in the choir at 
<a href='http://www.rc.net/worcester/stmary/'>St. Mary of the Hills</a>. 
It's our fun Thursday night out. We have more time for each other with 
Tom gone and Mark busy. </p>

<p>I grew up in Milton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Milton High School in
1975, Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital School of Nursing in 1978, and 
<a href="http://www.tui.edu/VC/">Vermont College</a> in 1984.</p>

<p>
I am currently a second-year student at the 
<a href='http://www.uchicago.edu'>University of Chicago</a>. I'm probably 
going to be concentrating in Political Science. At school I've enjoyed doing 
Model United Nations, including going to a conference at the University of 
Pennsylvania in November. I've also enjoyed living in one of the greatest 
cities in the country. My gorgeous dorm room is in a 
<a href='http://www.theshoreland.com/'>renovated luxury hotel</a> on 
Lake Michigan that overlooks the skyline, the lake, and the surrounding 
neighborhoods. The University is great, I love everyone on my floor. <!--Our 
residence heads, Paul and Kelly, live in the apartment on our floor and have 
a year old son, Liam. I'm constantly making trips over there to play with Liam 
and talk Red Sox with Paul.-->
</p>
<!--
<p>
I'm still a rabid Red Sox fan... disappointed about how '03 ended however I'm 
eternally hopeful for '04. I've also enjoyed the Patriots this year and their 
great season. I graduated in May from St. John's and had the longest summer of 
my life (I didn't leave for school until Sept. 20th). I'm still working my job 
at the movie theater when I'm home and seeing all the movies I can. I've 
had a great year in 2003 and I'm hoping for an even better one in 2004!
