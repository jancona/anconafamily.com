<p>Merry Christmas to all our friends!</p>

<p>I hope the new century has seen you well. I just had my 25<sup>th</sup>
high school reunion last weekend. I remember thinking in 1975 it would be 2000
at my 25<sup>th</sup>. How quickly time flies. I don’t feel any different,
though we all look different! We remain busy with life and boys and activities.
</p>

<p>Tommy is a sophomore at St. John’s in Shrewsbury. He loves
school and continues to excel. His favorite class is Modern European History,
Advanced Placement. I can see him majoring in History or Political Science. He
has become involved in Model United Nations and was selected to travel to the
University of Chicago in February with a delegation from school. He will also
head to NYC in March. He is involved in the History Club and started writing
stories for the school newspaper. I tell him he needs a job to afford these
trips. He does referee soccer games in the spring and fall. Tommy got his
learners permit after his 16<sup>th</sup> birthday this fall and is taking
driver’s ed. He is still quite involved in Scouts, going for Life Scout.</p>

<p>Mark is in 8<sup>th</sup> grade at St. Bernadette Catholic
School in Northborough. It was a good change for him. He thought it would be
really easy but it’s harder than he thought. He ran cross-country this fall and
is playing basketball this winter. He was just accepted to St. John’s for next
year, so I hope he’ll try out for soccer. He went to his first school dance and
said 9 seventh grade girls like him. Some things never change! He is getting
taller and is very upset about pimples. They ruin his image. </p>

<p>Jim started a new job in the spring. He is working at Xevo,
a start up in Marlboro, only 15 minutes from home. He drops Mark off at school
enroute to work every day. He feels much more challenged with his work. He
remains on the town Finance Committee and was just appointed to a committee to
investigate regionalization of the school system. He has been singing in the
choir with me. It’s our favorite evening out! </p>
